"Static_IP-DNS" is a quick script that will allow you to set your local IP address to static address, enabling you to forward specific ports in router settings if required without them falling off after IP address is renewed.  Additionally, sets primary and alternate DNS to Cloudflare addresses.
    **You need to input your desired Static IP address and your default gateway into script (replace the xxx) for this to work correctly**

"Whitelist_Apps" is a quick script that allows you to add specific applications to the whitelist of windows defender. This allows you to bypass unwanted issues with Windows Firewall blocking trusted apps.
